Building logistic regression model. 
Find a way for the model to have a correct prediction rate for the test set of 98 percent

# Task

# Preprocessing data
Read the received data and then process it in matrix form.

Data analysis, here I do not analyze and take all the properties of the data.

# Building
Build the original model.

Change some parameters such as number of layers, epochs ... to see the change of the histogram

Overwriting for Neural Network by: adding some properties to the object, reducing the layer of the network...

Change the activation function to consider.

The results were only 78 percent accurate on the last train.

##Conclusion
Due to the lack of experience with this problem, the use of some methods to increase accuracy is limited, leading to the failure of the instructor's wishes.
